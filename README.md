Compose is sort of the Main file, all others currently only contain reference
definitions.

Diacritics contains a number of groups for individual diacritics and other
modifications of letters.

Extended_Latin contains a group for ligatures and one for otherwise
unclassifiable Latin letters.

Symbols contains symbols of all sorts, except that

Arrows contains the arrows, as there are enough of them to warrant their own
file.

The files under blocks/ are named after Unicode blocks and contain definitions
that serve only to give names to characters for which no keysyms are defined
so as to avoid numeric keysyms in the other files as much as possible.
